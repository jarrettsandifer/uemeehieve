                            <p> Hi there. We are expanding our galley kitchen and have space in a bedroom right off the kitchen (50s bungalow style in suburban, upper midwest US). We are willing to knock down walls and have the knowledge to do most of the work ourselves, but we are struggling with visualizing the best layout and other options. Does anyone have experience with hiring a designer to draw up plans as a jumping off point? How did it go? Are there national chains you would recommend? Things I was told I absolutely had to have a custom countertop. Paid a tiny fortune for it. The fitters arrived. Wanted to know why I needed a custom worktop so they could fit it to my specs. I told them the blah blah blah blah blah the IKEA designer told me. They laughed. They said nope Standard worktop would have been fine. Paid three times the price. Anyone else have this happen Hi All, I am considering going with Ikea kitchen cabinets. Does anyone have an experience with the 0 in home appointment where they design your kitchen and build everything in the Ikea kitchen planning tool? Is it worth it? Should I hire a 3rd party planner? I have the same question for install. Should I have the ikea installer do everything (move water line etc.) or do you think I will be better off contracting it myself. 
I can't access any of my designs or create a new one. Tried Chrome, Edge, and Firefox with no luck. Can anyone. surprised no posts about this yet. i'm interested to see if any of the hardware will be compatible with old system. I'm having a brain fart and can't think of anything. I was great at visualizing the whole house but the kitchen is killing me. So here is the deal, I have an empty 234" by 161" room. Windows can go anywhere, this photo shows were the doors are and gives you a rough idea, nothing is too scale here. ( For the washer and dryer I was thinking of building a closet around them with some shelving over them. This is the view I really want to take advantage of. (http://i.i. 
I've been trying to access it for 2 days, from various computers- i received the following error message: "20-20 Virtual Planner: Connection to back office failed. Please try again later." Is anyone else having this problem. Wondering if anyone out there has used IKEA to design a kitchen--countertops, cabinets, etc. And, did you use them as contractors for the demo and build I'm too ahead of the curve and it's ruining I am completely enraged by the stupid f\ cking kitchen planner right now. I try to place a cabinet - can't do it. The cabinet is stuck to one wall and every time I move it it reverts back to that wall. Then magically it'll work after like 50 tries! I can put a built in microwave but I can't PICK the microwave so it's stuck me with a 0 microwave oven which I don't want. We're supposed to go in on Monday and I'm about to lose my shit just sitting here in my bed, much less having Hey Reddit, I recently had a experience with Ikea in their kitchen department, and wanted to tell you about my experience! Me and my BF went to Ikea, about a 6 months ago to see a kitchen planner, at Ikea. We had all our measurements, we knew all the colours we wanted, what handles, etc. When we arrived there, and went in store, we got told “Our appointment had been cancelled” we also got told that the next appointment was in about 1 hour. I didn’t think much of it, as we wondered towards. I used the kitchen planner. I went to the store three times. The ikea staff told me the design would work. The design clearly does not work. The corner cabinet will never be able to have a swing door on it. I could maybe do a tambour door, but not sure I want too. Aside from starting over, does anyone have any suggestions? Kitchen is L shape approximately 110 x115 Image (https://i.imgur.com/tYKtFvC.jpg). Any input would be appreciated - we are embarking on renovating the kitchen in our mother-in-law unit. https://imgur.com/a/zh16PZP (https://imgur.com/a/zh16PZP) I used the IKEA kitchen planner to help figure out the layout. The entire room is 20' x \~11.5' but there are a couple of doors/doorways that kind of break it up. As far as I know, the stove and sink can't be moved (since the outlet and water aren't going to move). My specific questions are: 1. Is there a better way to rearrange. So, I have my Ikea kitchen almost completely assembled, have made the requisite errors and corrections along the way (didn't notice that one set of instructions was for bottom vs middle drawers, etc), but the very last drawers I tried to install posed a totally new and hard to solve problem for me. I've actually decided to switch to baskets in this area, so this is not a problem I need to fix, but I couldn't find any post about this and thought maybe I could help some poor frustrated person. We (family of 3) need some help how to layout our new kitchen, We have some ideas, but non of them really is what we want. We have open kitchen/dining/living apartment layout, but more on that in pictures. Something about kitchen: dimensions (on Ikea images): where is washing area from corner to an end of kitchen is 211cm where is cooking top (we don't want to pass) 370cm for planing we used Ikea kitchen planner tool (https://kitchenplanner.ikea.com/gb/UI/Pages/VPUI.htm?_ga. 
Hello all! So we are starting our kitchen reno soon and after going over the plans for the millionth time I've realized something and need some input. We are using IKEA for all the cabinetry but are purchasing other brand name appliances/sinks/faucets etc. We are putting in an island which will contain the sink and dishwasher and the dishwasher will be on the very end of the island. the IKEA kitchen online planner doesn't have any options to finish off the very end of the island where the dishw. Help! I've finally moved out of the parents house into a small \~350sqft studio and I would really like to put together a Scandinavian inspired space suitable for a guy in his mid 20s. Any help is greatly appreciated! First of all, here is the unfurnished space (https://imgur.com/a/Fyo1Drp). I'd like to get an idea of what colour furniture works with the white walls and the flooring. I plan on starting with the essentials and slowly adding in accents over the next few months. I will be moving. Finally moving into a completely unfurnished apartment and having to buy a kitchen. Because space is rare, I came up with the idea of multi-purposing the dining table as a kitchen work area, making the whole place more socialable. I got lucky and found exactly what I was looking for at IKEA (https://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/20359154/). Because of its rather strong accents I'm thinking about getting the rest from IKEA too, making it match. I drew a sketch in their kitchen planner. 
So, recently purchased a fixer upper, and the first order of business is to open up and reno the kitchen to create an open concept space. I've never attempted to design a kitchen before, and I'm using Ikea's Kitchen Planner (which has been pretty user-friendly), but mostly I'm wondering if there's anything obvious I'm missing. In particular: - I think my biggest question mark is the location of the range (30"). If I have to work around the existing windows, the stove ends up with little surfa. </p>
